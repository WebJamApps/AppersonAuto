## HOSTING

<https://www.appersonautomotive.com/>

We use Heroku to host this website, which is a static React frontend that runs on a node server.js (Express.js) server. There is a Procfile that tells Heroku to run the server.js file and both of these files are needed so please do NOT delete them.
